ChangeLog
=========

v0.04 - 2005-01-12:

	The constructor has been fixed so that it won't carp when given empty
	data, so that programs using this module can create empty objects and
	populate the dataset themselves. Added a munge to the supplied locale if
	it's in the xx_YY.CHARSET format to strip off .CHARSET. Added a simple
	test script, and fixed a couple of ambiguous keys() calls that showed up
	with -w.

v0.03 - 2005-01-03:

	Implemented modification of values, and serialisation using as_string().
	Improved documentation.

v0.02 - 2005-01-01:

	Forgot to change the new() method's name to new_from_data(). Oops.

v0.01 - 2005-01-01:

	Initial release.
